Emergency Preparedness,"Unexpected events—such as earthquakes, floods, and terrorist attacks—can cause widespread problems. Although these situations are rare, you can plan for labor and birth at home if a disaster prevents you from getting to a hospital or birth center. Birth has occurred in homes for centuries and can be very safe if you are prepared."
Call for Help,"Keep an up-to-date contact list of anyone who may be able to come to help you with the birth. Keep the family car filled with gas if you are getting close to your due date. If you do go into labor during a disaster, first try to reach your midwife, doctor, or hospital. If you can’t reach your health care provider, call 911. If you have telephone service, a health care provider or 911 operator can ‘talk you through’ labor and birth."
Prepare the Room,Cover the bed with a shower curtain and then place a clean sheet over the shower curtain so you keep the mattress from getting wet. Have your front door unlocked so that rescue workers can get into your home. Get your kit of supplies out and have it open by your bed.

Instructions for Your Helper During Labor,Stay calm and keep the area as clean as possible. Help keep the mom comfortable. Place some towels under her to catch fluid when the bag of waters breaks and for vaginal bleeding that can occur during labor. The first stage of labor can last from a few hours to several hours.
Instructions for Your Helper During the Birth,"1. As soon as the head is out, feel around the head to see if the cord is around the baby’s neck. The cord is slippery, round, and feels jelly-like.
2. If the cord is around the neck, gently lift it over the head or push it back behind the shoulders.
3. If the shoulders do not come out immediately: Gently push the side of the baby’s head toward the mother’s back to help the shoulders come out and ask her to push.
4. If the shoulders still do not come out: Have the mom lie on her back and pull her knees up toward her chest, then ask her to push."
Instructions for Your Helper with the New Baby,"1. When the baby is born, place the baby on the mother’s bare chest and cover both of them with a blanket.
2. If the baby is not crying or breathing easily: Rub the baby’s back up and down firmly.
3. If the baby is still not crying or breathing easily: Turn the baby so he/she is looking up at the ceiling and tilt his/her head back to straighten the airway, and keep rubbing the back.
4. If the baby is gagging or turning blue: Use the bulb syringe to clear fluid from the nose and mouth.
5. Tie the umbilical cord in 2 places close together about 3 inches from the baby with the white shoelaces."
Instructions for Your Helper with the Placenta,"1. The placenta will be ready to come out within a few minutes to about 30 minutes after the birth.
2. As soon as the placenta is out, the mother’s bleeding will be like bleeding from a heavy period. Getting the baby to breastfeed is very important, because it will slow down the bleeding after birth."
